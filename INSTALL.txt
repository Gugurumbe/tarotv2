Additional dependencies
=======================

In order to compile this package, you will also need:

*c++, g++, or clang
*qmake (optional)
*qdoc
*moc
*uic
*rcc

The 3 c++ compilers are the executables searched in PATH. If you have another compiler, it will work fine provided that you change your PATH and / or do some ln -s.

QMake is optional, but if it is not found in PATH, the other Qt tools, the libs and the incs will be searched in PATH and not in qmake -query paths.
